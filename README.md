GreetingsðŸ‘‹! Iâ€™m Johann, a globe-trotting self taught programmer who currently calls Los Angeles home. By day, I'm a proud member of [Disney Streaming's](https://www.linkedin.com/company/disney-streaming) Applied R&D team, working on cutting-edge streaming innovations. By night, I channel my creativity into building startups like [Ask Carl](https://www.ask-carl.com/) - the world's first Immigration as a Software Service. I'm also a passionate musician, surfer, dad and husband.
